Comment:
 The verbatim text for the license assignment used is:
 """
 Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
 found in the LICENSE file.
 """
 The LICENSE file is not present, I'm assuming this refers to the BSD-3-clause
 used in the grpc parts (which is embedded in the files).
